<mark><b>Can machines think? â€” Alan Turing, 1950</b></mark>
<p><br>Alan turing change how is the world today by this sentence, after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II.</br>
<br>Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.</br>
<br><b>What makes a machine intelligent?</b></br>

  <li>Thinking humanly</li>
  <li>Thinking rationally</li>
  <li>Acting humanly</li>
  <li>Acting rationally</li>
</ol>

<p><br>The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior. Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines AI as  "algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together."</br> 
<br>"AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules."</br>
