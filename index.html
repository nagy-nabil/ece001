<h1>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?</h1> 
<p><br>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important branch of computer science,</br>
<br>his mission is building smart machines capable to do tasks that require human intelligence,</br>
<br>science fiction always imagine AL as robots with human- like characteristics, it can be anything from Google's
 search algorithms,</br>
<br>al make it possible  for machine to learn from experience as human being, Most AI examples that you hear about
 today</br><br>from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars â€“ rely heavily on deep learning and natural language
 processing</br> </p>
 <b>Artificial intelligence is classified into</b>
<ul style="color:SlateBlue;">
<li><b>Narrow AI:</b>Sometimes called "weak AL" this kinds is a simulation of human intelligence, usually it works on
 a single task extremely well, but it works under limitations than even the most basic human intelligence </li>
 <strong>A few examples of Narrow AI include</strong>
   <ul>
       <li>Google search</li>
	   <li>Image recognition software</li>
	   <li>Siri, Alexa and other personal assistants</li>
	</ul>	
<li><b>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</b>Sometimes referred to as "strong AL" we see that kinds in movies
 likethe robots from westworld, is a machine with general intelligence, like human being, that can work with any 
 task, AGI has long been the muse of dystopian science fiction, in which super-intelligent robots overrun humanity,
 but experts agreeit's not something we need to worry about anytime soon.</li>
