<h1>benfits and risks of Artificial  intelligence</h1>
<p><strong>what will happen if the quest for strong AI succeeds and an AI system becomes better than humans</strong>,By inventing revolutionary new technologies, such a superintelligence might help us eradicate war, disease, and poverty, and so the creation of strong AI might be the biggest event in human history</p>
<h3>HOW CAN AI BE DANGEROUS?</h3>
<p>Most researchers agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, when considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely:</p>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;" "font-size:110%;">
     <li><strong style="color:Tomato;">The AI is programmed to do something devastating:</strong>Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties.could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply “turn off,” so humans could plausibly lose control.</li>
	 <li><strong style="color:Tomato;">The AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal:</strong>This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI’s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for.</li>
 </ul> 
    
<h3>Why is artificial intelligence important?</h3>
 <ul style="font-size:110%;">
    <li><b style="color:Tomato;">AI automates repetitive learning and discovery through data.</b> AI performs frequent, high-volume, computerized tasks reliably and without fatigue. For this type of automation, human inquiry is still essential to set up the system and ask the right questions.</li>
	<li><b style="color:Tomato;">AI achieves incredible accuracy</b> through deep neural networks. For example, your interactions with Alexa, Google Search and Google Photos are all based on deep learning, and they keep getting more accurate the more we use them.</li>
 </ul>
