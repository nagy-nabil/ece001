<h1>Artificial intelligence history</h1> 
<p>Artificial intelligence was coined in 1956 but it has become more popular today because of increasing in data 
volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage<br>In 1950s topics like problem 
solving and symbolic methods, in1960s In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type
 of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning,  And DARPA produced intelligent personal 
 assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana</br></p>
